## W-Net for Pennycress Segmentation
This repository contains code for a W-Net for unsupervised segmentation of Pennycress *(Thlaspi arvense)* Leaves. There are four directories in this repository:

* data: contains the training and testing data that was used to train and evaluate our model.
* logs: contains the `log.csv` file produced during model training.
* checkpoints: contains the model weights in the form of `.pt` files
* notebooks: contains the `.ipynb` notebooks used for the model training/inference.
* utils: contains the `.py` scripts called by notebooks during model training/inference.
