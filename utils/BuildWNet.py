''' Each module consists of two 3 x 3 conv layers, each followed by a ReLU
non-linearity and batch normalization.

In the expansive path, modules are connected via transposed 2D convolution
layers.

The input of each module in the contracting path is also bypassed to the
output of its corresponding module in the expansive path

we double the number of feature channels at each downsampling step
We halve the number of feature channels at each upsampling step
